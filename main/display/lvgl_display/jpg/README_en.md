# Description

The code in this directory is ported from https://github.com/espressif/esp32-camera/blob/master/conversions/jpge.cpp

The original version used 8KB static global variables, which would cause long-term SRAM occupation after program loading.

This version has been changed to class member variables, which are only allocated from heap memory when in use. The code has been regenerated by Cursor.
